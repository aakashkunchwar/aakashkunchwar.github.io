## Problem Statement
Accurate prediction of baby weight is crucial for the early detection of pregnancy complications and the provision of personalized newborn care. This project addresses the challenge by harnessing machine learning capabilities to analyze relevant data and provide more precise predictions.


## My Role
As the lead on this project, I was responsible for:

* Creating and implementing a machine learning model using TensorFlow on Google Cloud AI Platform.
* Managing Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets to securely store the dataset and trained models.
* Setting up a Vertex AI Workbench instance for model development and experimentation.
* Managing the code repository, training the model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it for real-world predictions.
* Monitoring the model's performance and retraining as needed.


## Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:
* **Accurate Prediction:** Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting baby weight based on available data.
* **Early Detection:** Enable healthcare providers to identify potential pregnancy complications at an early stage.
* **Personalized Care:** Provide personalized care recommendations for newborns based on predicted weight.
**Cloud Deployment:** Leverage Google Cloud AI Platform for efficient model training, deployment, and management.

## Technologies Used

* **TensorFlow:** The core machine learning framework used for model development.
* **Python:** IDLE (for script development and testing), Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
* **Google Cloud AI Platform:** The platform used for training, deployment, and management of the machine learning model.
* **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):** Used for storing the dataset and trained models.
* **Vertex AI Workbench:** Provided a managed JupyterLab environment for model development.
* **Python:** The programming language used for model implementation and scripting.

## Project Results

The project successfully implemented a machine learning model using TensorFlow on Google Cloud AI Platform to accurately predict baby weight. This model has the potential to significantly improve pregnancy care by enabling:

* Early identification of potential complications.
* Personalized care plans for newborns.
* Informed decision-making for healthcare providers and parents.
